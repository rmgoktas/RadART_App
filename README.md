# Basic UI for Art Genre Recognition ML Model
An application interface that allows us to send queries to an AI model deployed on AWS. We can predict the types of art paintings. You can visit this [repository](https://github.com/rmgoktas/RadART_ONNX_Model) for an example usage of the model, and if you would like to learn the deployment process yourself, you can read this [article](https://rmgoktas.medium.com/deploy-a-machine-learning-onnx-model-on-aws-ec2-using-flask-41d0823b7064).
